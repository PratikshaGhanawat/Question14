Develop a feature-rich ASP.NET web application that includes 
various validation techniques and utilizes rich controls. The

Form Validation:
a) Create a web page with a form that collects user registration 
information (e.g., username, email, password).
b) Extend the registration form to include a custom validation 
rule (e.g., mobile numbers must be unique and 10 digits). 
Implement a custom validator to enforce this rule on the 
server-side
